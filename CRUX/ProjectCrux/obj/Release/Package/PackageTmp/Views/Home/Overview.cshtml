                <h4 class="inner-head" style="font-size: x-large;"> The Crux Experience </h4>
                <p>
                    It’s simple. We want to help students learn better — and faster. That’s why we’ve designed our platform based on proven teaching methods verified by top researchers.
                </p>

                <h4 class="inner-head-1" style="font-size: x-large;"> Global Learning </h4>
                <p>
                    Students across different universities are interconnetced at one place. They share informations on similar topics and give immediate feedback on a concept a student did not understand.
                </p>
                <p> &nbsp;</p>
                <h4 class="inner-head-2" style="font-size: x-large;"> Collaborative Learning </h4>
                <p>
                    Unlike individual learning, people engaged in collaborative learning capitalize on one another’s resources and skills (asking one another for information, evaluating one another’s ideas, monitoring one another’s work, etc.).
                </p>

                <h4 class="inner-head-3" style="font-size: x-large;"> Peer Assessments </h4>
                <p>
                    We use peer assessments, where students can evaluate and provide feedback on each other’s work. This technique has been shown in many studies to result in accurate feedback for the student and a valuable learning experience for them.
